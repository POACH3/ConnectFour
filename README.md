# Overview of Connect Four
Connect Four is the final project for CSIS2420. It is an implementation of the traditional Connect Four game against a computer. This is done with a graph that is used to store generated game states which are then searched to find winning game conditions. A mediocre algorithm has been implemented where the computer moves toward a random "nearest" winning game condition unless the human player is about to make a winning move, in which case the computer blocks the human.
